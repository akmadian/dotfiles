My dotfiles and scripts, most scripts are just in .local/bin, most actual dotfiles are in .config/whatever.

The install script just goes through the .config and .local dirs and creates symlinks for each file.

I don't use all of the things I have files for in .config, currently I use:
  - suckless' st
  - fish
  - neovim
